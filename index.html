					<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/Paranal.jpg" alt="Jennifer at Paranal Observatory" /></span>
					<p>I’m a PhD student in Astrophysics at the Instituto de Astrofísica e Ciências do Espaço and the University of Porto, in Portugal.</p>
					<p>My main research interests focus on understanding how stellar activity influences the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres through high-resolution spectroscopy.</p>
					<p>I grew up in Mexico City until I was 20 years old, when I decided to pursue my dream of becoming an astronomer. I moved to Santiago de Chile to complete my undergraduate degree in Astronomy at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile. During my studies, I worked on a variety of projects, from analyzing active galaxies with MUSE data to searching for exoplanets using ground-based telescopes in Chile.</p>
					<p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with friends and going to the gym. I also have a passion for analog photography (you can check out some of my 35 mm photos on Instagram: <a href="https://instagram.com/jenn35mm" target="_blank">@jenn35mm</a>).</p>
					<p>But my favorite hobby is definitely traveling and discovering new places!</p>

						<h3>Revision of the ESPRESSO Calibration Plan</h3>
						<span class="image main"><img src="images/ESPRESSO_first_light_spectrum.jpg" alt="ESPRESSO spectrum" /></span>
						<p>ESPRESSO is a high-resolution echelle spectrograph on ESO's Very Large Telescope (VLT), designed for ultra-high radial velocity accuracy and extreme spectral fidelity in exoplanet research. It operates at a resolving power of 140,000–190,000, covering the 378.2 to 788.7 nm range.</p>
						<p>A key part of astronomical data handling is reduction — the process that transforms raw images into science-ready data. Like many instruments, ESPRESSO relies on a calibration plan with both short-term (bias, flats, Th-Ar lamps) and long-term (fiber efficiency, etc.) calibrations. But how far can we push their temporal validity?</p>
						<p>During the ESO Summer Students Chile 2023 Program, held at the European Southern Observatory, I worked under the supervision of Dr. Matias Jones to answer this question. I analyzed calibration data from ESPRESSO, testing the validity period of each type of calibration based on instrument stability. The goal is to determine how “old” a calibration can be while still ensuring high-quality reduced data for detecting Earth-like planets and studying small planet atmospheres at high spectral resolution.</p>

						<h3>Exoplanet Detection with the CHIRON Spectrograph</h3>

						<p>The search for exoplanets has deepened our understanding of planetary systems and opened vast possibilities for discovering new worlds. Over the last decade, improved instruments have significantly increased the number of confirmed exoplanets—more than 800 via the radial velocity (RV) method alone.</p>
						<p>In August 2021, under the supervision of Dr. James Jenkins, I began developing an algorithm to extract radial velocities from stellar spectra obtained with the CHIRON spectrograph, mounted on the 1.5 m CTIO/SMARTS telescope. The algorithm uses the cross-correlation method with a noise-free binary mask to confirm and characterize exoplanet candidates from the TESS mission.</p>
						<p>My research aims to contribute to the study of the <strong>Neptune Desert</strong>—a region with a notable scarcity of Neptune-sized exoplanets in short-period orbits (&lt;4 days). By applying my method to systems like TOI-1107 and TOI-2218, I seek to detect extreme Neptune-like planets and deliver precise mass and density measurements, enabling future studies of their atmospheric chemistry and formation processes.</p>
